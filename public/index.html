    Note: <i>All code samples were developed on the latest stable Chrome and finally tested on Microsoft Edge.</i><br><br>
    The work itself was done in segments, starting Thursday afternoon for Ex1 (one swoop), Thursday evening for Ex2 (one swoop) and Thursday 
    night and Friday morning and afternoon for Ex3 (multiple sittings in-between).<br>
    To each excercise I've added a description of the mindset, research and final work, as best I can.

      <p>This excercise took total 40 minutes.</p>
      <p>
        The <code>:hover</code> pseudo-element was the easy part. I rememberd that.<br>
        The harder part was to remember how to correctly position the menu element.
        At first, I thought about floating the element. Then I saw it didn't work,
        so I googled "css layers" because I was thinking about z-index
        and came across <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/Stacking_without_z-index">this
          MDN article</a>
        and then I slapped myself for forgetting about <code>position:absolute</code> and <code>position:relative</code>
        and it was a breeze from there. I spent another few minutes "prettifying" it. :)<br>
        Oh, and to test more than one item, I quickly looked up the css grid. I need to read that in more detail, once
        I'm done with this.<br>
        After thoughts: After I completed the excercises, I came back to this with a small suspicion about the structure.<br>
        I ended up spending 10 more minutes fixing two issues:
        <ol>
          <li>used standard HTML list elements <code>ul/li</code></li>
          <li>When item name was long, the hover on the next header didn't "kick in". I gave the headers z-index priority to solve this.</li>
        </ol>

    <h1>Excercise 2 - Toggle style using react and mobx</h1>
    <div id="ex2" class="demo"></div>
    <div>
      <p>This excercise took total 1 hour.</p>
      <p>
        The basics were easy, I started with <code>npx react-create-app myapp</code>,
        and I mostly followed the code example in the mobx getting started page.
        I split the code into <code>view</code>/<code>model</code> files for better structure.
        Problems started because of my setup which didn't like the <code>@</code> decorator.
        For the <code>@observable</code>, the solution was available in the code example,
        but for some reason the <code>observer</code> solution wasn't. A quick Google search solved that.<br>
        Then I had some stupid bugs about naming (I named the prop in the component <code>itemsList</code>),
        but in the index.js I created an attribute named <code>items</code>. ðŸ¤¦

    <h1>Excercise 3 - Implement HSL color picker</h1>
    <div id="ex3" class="demo"></div>
    <p>This basic excercise took total 2 hours (+2h for the hue slider, total 4h).</p>
    <p>
      I broke the solution down into two parts.
      <ol>
        <li>Draw the color picker with css gradients</li>
        <li>use <code>offsetLeft</code> and <code>offsetTop</code> to identify the click position and calculate the
          correct gardient</li>
      </ol>
      I knew that once I got the gradient right, I would understand how to calculate the values as well - I expected
      they would correlate.
      (Spoiler: I was right :).
      I tried figuring it out myself, for about 1.5 hours of reading the specs of gradients, and nothing really worked
      as expected. Somehwere in those research hours I came across <code>&lt;input type="color"&gt;</code>. Good to know.<br />
      At the end I decided I've spent too much time on the theory and it did not move me on fast enough, so I went to
      look at examples of web color pickers. Google has one built in to search, but it used <code>canvas</code>,
      and I wasn't interested in going down a whole nother reasearch path, if I didn't have to. Though I'm till curious
      how it works. Then I landed on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool">MDNs color picker</a>
      and that had a good example with the CSS I was looking for.<br>
      The next problem was getting the cross-browser to work. I saw they were using the browser prefixes, and
      experiments showed that the none-prefixed version seems to work differently, though some quick search didn't provide an answer to why.<br>
      The next challenge was to figure out why the CSS, copied from MDN, was acting up if I had multiple browser elements.
      The only difference I could notice was that my style was compiled inline in the element's CSS, while the MDN version
      was using a css file. I copied the background styles into style.css, and it worked. Yet another thing to investigate.<br>
      Finally, now that the box was displaying the colors as expected, I could look at the top-to-bottom, left-to-right,
      and as I expected, I could see how the HSL gradient is calculated. As Intended originally, the element's offset,
      compared to the mouse position on page gave me the lightness and saturation (had to inverse the lightness).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Update</b>: +2h of work to add a slider to select the hue. Most of the time was spent figuring out how to get
      all the parts to play nicely together. Just goes to show how much it's worth to do a tidy job. Once I got all the data
      set on the component's state, I could see it's not updating, and I recalled that setState is async. 
      How nice of them to have a callback function, which solved the whole issue.<br>
      Still would be nice to have a marker in the staturation/light box, to show where the selector is at the moment.

      <br>
      <b>Things to learn</b>:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>How does that canvas version work?</li>
        <li>What's the difference between the standard and the browser-prefixed "linear-gradient" CSS property</li>
        <li>Why do browser-prefixed styles work in css files and not in-body style elements?</li>
      </ul>
